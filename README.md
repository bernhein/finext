 * Allow piping with python code and STAAD Pro
    * For python, following can be checked out: 
      - ZeroMQ - maybe complicated, but very generic,and also ZeroRPC, and some info here (http://ianhinsdale.com/code/2013/12/08/communicating-between-nodejs-and-python/) 
      - edge.js - Allows running python, .NET code from node.js
      - node-python 
      
    * For STAAD-Pro, using .NET may be more robust than VBA
  
  * Prepare WebGL/UI options
  
  * Include libraries like annyang for speech recognition
  
  * Explore options for speeding up the server, 
    * Try deploying parts to multiple services
    * Try map-reduce etc. 
    * make the code non-blocking
